Instructions:
- You're given a piece of PYTHON CODE containing a function called __FUNCTION_NAME__. Your goal is to revise the PYTHON CODE so that we can directly call the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATIONS.
- You should edit the original PYTHON CODE as little as possible and you can add code only if necessary.
- DO NOT call any external API, database, etc. Instead, create a mock interface.
- Make sure that your code can be directly executed without any modification. For example, statements like `token = "your_auth_token_here"  # You need to replace this with a real token` is NOT allowed.
- If you need to write files to the disk, use `{docker_CACHE_DIR}` as the directory.

- Provide your reasoning and the revised PYTHON CODE below SOLUTION.

PYTHON CODE:
```python
__CODE__
```

Your answer should follow the format below:

Reasoning: ...
```python
# Your Code. 
```

Do NOT include other formatting. Output every token of the content with no omission or abbreviation.

Instructions:
- You're given a piece of PYTHON CODE containing a function called __FUNCTION_NAME__. We also provide you the CONTEXT of the PYTHON CODE. Your goal is to aggregate the PYTHON CODE and the CONTEXT into one script, so that we can directly call the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATIONS.
- You should edit the original PYTHON CODE as little as possible and you can add code only if necessary.
- DO NOT call any external API, database, etc. Instead, create a mock interface.

test_generation_prompt_template = f"""\
Instructions:
- You're given a piece of PYTHON CODE containing a function called __FUNCTION_NAME__. Assume we will later have another implentation of the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function called __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation.
- Your goal is to add (1) a test function called __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__ to check whether __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation has the same functionality as the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function, and (2) a __main__ function that calls the test function.
- If the PYTHON CODE already contains a __main__ function, remove it and write a new __main__ function.
- The test function __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__ should contain at least 3 assert statements. If __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation has different functionality as __FUNCTION_NAME__, an Assertion Error should be triggered.
- The test function __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__ should cover all the major branches of the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function
- DO NOT test on error handling and DO NOT test on the print information in the function.
- The __main__ function should NOT contain a try-except structure. If the implementation is incorrect, the program should have a non-zero exit code.
- You should edit the original PYTHON CODE as little as possible.
- If you need to write files to the disk, use `{docker_CACHE_DIR}` as the directory.

- Provide your reasoning and the new PYTHON CODE containing your test function __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__ and the __main__ function below SOLUTION.

PYTHON CODE:
```python
__CODE__

Your answer should follow the format below:

Reasoning: ...
```python
# The new PYTHON CODE containing your test function __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__ and the __main__ function.
```

Do NOT include other formatting. Output every token of your edited PYTHON CODE with no omission or abbreviation.

debug_prompt_template = f"""\
Instructions:
- You're given a piece of PYTHON CODE containing a function called __FUNCTION_NAME__ and its test function called __TEST_FUNCTION_NAME__. Assume we will later add another function called __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation, the test function aims to check whether __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation has the same functionality as __FUNCTION_NAME__.
- In our experiments, we implemented __FUNCTION_NAME___new_implementation exactly the same as __FUNCTION_NAME__, but the PYTHON CODE cannot be successfully executed. 
- Your task is to debug PYTHON CODE based on the ERROR MESSAGE.
- You should modify the code as little as possible, especially the test___FUNCTION_NAME__ function and the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function.
- Make sure that after debugging, the test function test___FUNCTION_NAME__ still have at least three assert statements and cover all the major branches of the __FUNCTION_NAME__ function.
- DO NOT test on error handling and DO NOT test on the print information in the function.
- If you need to write files to the disk, use `{docker_CACHE_DIR}` as the directory.

- Provide your reasoning and the debugged PYTHON CODE below SOLUTION. If necessary, output the bash scripts for Linux in another code block in the format of ```bash ... ```.

PYTHON CODE:
```python

ERROR MESSAGE:

Your answer should follow the format below:
